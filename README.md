# Oftenhide Demo Engine v1

First version of the Oftenhide Demo engine, initiated around 2015 as an attempt to:
- come back to the world of C++ (with C++11/14 features to be tested in, primarily the way memory is addressed, pimpl and few more goodies that you can spot in
- check if software rendering can be reintroduced on modern platforms that still can enable virtualized frame buffer access via texture rendering
- release a demo when the complete team is ready (and assembled in the first place), which I managed in 2018, for the Memory Remains demo that was released at Riverwash 2018

Then abandoned in unfinished state, which I'm publishing here. Lot of pre-mature experiments built into this code regarding 3D rasterization and effects. Only a fraction of its envisioned features was used in Memory Remains when me and Angelo realized that the quality of the code is so low, that it's better to rewrite the whole concept from the beginnign for another production.

We we did with Simulacrum (that co-won Xenium 2019 a year later) with Oftenhide Demo Engine v2.
